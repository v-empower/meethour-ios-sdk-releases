//  Meet Hour iOS SDK — Swift Package Manager manifest.
//
//  The xcframeworks are NOT referenced by path out of this repository. They are
//  downloaded from the GitHub Release whose tag matches `sdkVersion` below.
//  Every release adds ~1 GB of binaries, and Swift Package Manager always does a
//  full (never shallow) clone of a package repository, so path-based binary
//  targets would force every consumer to download the entire history before
//  resolution. Remote binary targets let SPM fetch only the artifacts for the
//  version actually being resolved.
//
//  `scripts/make-spm-release.sh` produces the zips and rewrites the checksums
//  below, in the same spirit as MeetHourSDK.podspec.tpl -> MeetHourSDK.podspec.
//

// Keep in sync with MeetHourSDK.podspec. Also the Git tag that carries the
